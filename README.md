## Summary:

Welcome to the world's greatest ACFT Calculator Application. This is a full stack application that runs a Python Flask server which serves a webpage that allows for multiple users to input and track their ACFT scores over time. The server uses a persistent SQL database to store information. 

## Steps to run:

1. Install Python dependencies:
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
2. Navigate to src/ directory
3. Run server script:
```python3 server.py```
4. Navigate to webpage in browser:
```http://127.0.0.1:5000/```
5. Sign up for an account
6. Log in to account
7. Input ACFTs as desired (they will be shown at the bottom)

## Future Additions:

In the future, we would create a more dynamic dashboard page with more detailed analytics of ACFT scores over time. Potentially showing the users progress in individual events over time. Additionally, we would implement a permissions system so that leaders would be able to view the ACFTs of their subordinates to track their progress and identify areas of improvement to modify PT plans.

## Secret String:

Good luck finding it!
